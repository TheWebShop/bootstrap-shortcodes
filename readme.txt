Wordpress plugin to add shortcodes for Twitter Bootstrap 4.0

== Description ==

## Latest Bootstrap

Bootstrap Shortcodes allow quick and easy implementation of Twitter Bootstrap components through the TinyMCE rich-editor.

## Requirements
The plugin works out of the box!
Except: You use a bootstrap based theme - make sure to disable the enqueue of JS and CSS in the settings. (Because then they are already present)

## Supported Shortcodes

We add a row of buttons to the bottom of your post editor Visual mode, each of which gives options for inserting Bootstrap's most popular components.

### CSS

* Alerts
* Buttons
* Grid (container, row, columns, fully responsive)
* Icons
* Badges
* Lead Text
* Blockquotes
* Cards


### JavaScript

* Collapse
* Alerts

## Support

Please report issues directly to our [Github repository](https://github.com/TheWebShop/bootstrap-shortcodes/issues).

== Installation ==

1. Unzip files.
2. Upload the folder into your plugins directory.
3. Activate the plugin.
4. Add new shortcodes to posts or pages.
